            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Tender leaves of cabbage are wrapped around a hearty sirloin and rice filling and topped with a homemade tomato sauce in this family-friendly recipe for stuffed cabbage leaves. The hint of allspice and slight tang from vinegar create a perfect balance in this dish. They remind me of eating at a Lebanese food festival, although not quite as spicy. Serve with Greek salad or tabouli salad and warm pita for the perfect bite! </p>
